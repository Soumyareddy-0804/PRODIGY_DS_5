# 🚦 Task-05: Traffic Accident Data Analysis
> Internship Project at **Prodigy InfoTech**

## 📌 Objective
Analyze traffic accident data to identify critical patterns related to:
- Road conditions
- Weather factors
- Time of day
- Location hotspots

## 📁 Dataset
[Kaggle: US Accident EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Folium (for interactive maps)
- Google Colab

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations

1. **Time-Based Patterns**  
   ⏰ Hourly, weekly, and monthly analysis of accident frequency  
   📍 Rush hour vs normal hours

2. **Weather Conditions & Severity**  
   🌧️ Top weather types with accident count  
   🔍 Visibility vs Severity  
   🌡️ Temperature distribution

3. **Road Condition Analysis**  
   🚦 Impact of road infrastructure like signals, roundabouts  
   ☀️ Sunrise/Sunset condition effect

4. **Geospatial Mapping**  
   🗺️ Accident hotspots by state and city  
   🔥 Interactive heatmap of accident density

5. **Correlation & Severity Insights**  
   📈 Feature correlation heatmap  
   🔬 Severity vs visibility, temperature, and time

## 💡 Key Insights
- Peak accidents occur during **rush hours (7–9 AM, 4–6 PM)**
- **Rainy and foggy** weather increases severity risk
- **California and Los Angeles** have the highest accident concentration
- Weekend and evening hours tend to be more prone to severe incidents

## ✅ Deliverables
- `accident_analysis_summary.csv`  
- `state_analysis.csv`  
- `top_cities_analysis.csv`  
- `accident_heatmap.html`

## 🧠 Recommendations
- Deploy more traffic patrol during peak hours
- Install real-time traffic alerts during bad weather
- Improve visibility signs and lighting at hotspots
- Monitor top 10 cities with highest severity scores
